           Dr. Dhaliwal graduated from New York Chiropractic College (NYCC) where he earned a Doctor of Chiropractic degree in 2016. Prior to this, he completed his Bachelor of Science Honours degree in Biomedical Biology from Laurentian University. Dr. Dhaliwal is a proud member of the Alberta College and Association of Chiropractors, as well as the Canadian Chiropractic Association. He has worked extensively as a Clinic Director / Chiropractor in private practice with motor vehicle accident patients, along with patients who have sustained workplace injuries. He continues to work as a chiropractic doctor performing thorough assessments by attaining detailed medical histories and performing a wide array of orthopedic tests. With this information, he then develops and provides individually-tailored treatment plans depending on the patient's injuries, needs, goals and lifestyle. Dr. Dhaliwal understands the importance of remaining up-to-date and furthering his education and chiropractic skills. Furthermore, Dr. Dhaliwal has participated in volunteer work with the under-privileged in Buffalo, NY to help treat the pain they were experiencing as a result of a variety of different causes. He also educated patients under his care about the importance and effectiveness of chiropractic treatment, proper biomechanics and general health and wellness. In addition to his passion for his career, Dr. Dhaliwal has a profound interest in pain science, current research social justices and sports. Dr. Dhaliwal first encountered chiropractic care when he sustained an injury after getting cross-checked in the back while playing competitive ice hockey. After injuring his back, he was unable to achieve any relief from modern traditional medication and soon realised that the medication was only masking his symptoms rather than addressing and fixing the root cause of his pain. Upon receiving consistent chiropractic treatments, he for the first time started gaining relief from his back pain. At this point, Dr. Dhaliwal understood that medication is not the cure to musculoskeletal problems. It was after this realization that he joined NYCC to obtain the knowledge and clinical skills necessary to help those in need. Maintaining an active lifestyle throughout his life, he now encourages his patients to do the same. Dr. Dhaliwal is excited to have the opportunity to provide quality patient care that follows a holistic and evidence-based approach. He believes the mind-body connection is necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle, in which chiropractic adjustments are a major core component of. Chiropractic adjustments allow the nerves in the body to communicate freely without being impinged upon by tight muscles, joint restrictions and immobility. Healthy nutrition, active lifestyle and adjustments are the way to a mobile, pain-free life. ALWAYS KEEP MOVING!!!
